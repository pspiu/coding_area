Description: Given a non-empty array of integers, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.
Note: Your algorithm should have a linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it without using extra memory?

class Solution {
    public int singleNumber(int[] nums) {
int i=1; int res=nums[0];
    while(i<nums.length)
    {
     res^=nums[i];i++;
    }
        return res;
    }
}
