Topic: Counting Elements
Description: Given an integer array arr, count element x such that x + 1 is also in arr.
If there're duplicates in arr, count them seperately.
Example 1:
Input: arr = [1,2,3]
Output: 2
Explanation: 1 and 2 are counted cause 2 and 3 are in arr.

class Solution {
    public int countElements(int[] arr) {
       List<Integer> l = new ArrayList<Integer>();
        for(int a : arr)
            l.add(a);
        int count=0;
        for(int ele : l)
        {
            if(l.contains(ele+1))
                count++;
        }
        return count;
    }
}
