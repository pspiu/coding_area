Topic: Diameter of Binary Tree
Description: Given a binary tree, you need to compute the length of the diameter of the tree. 
The diameter of a binary tree is the length of the longest path between any two nodes in a tree. 
This path may or may not pass through the root.

class Solution {
    int ans;
    public int diameterOfBinaryTree(TreeNode root) {
        ans = 0;
        depth(root);
        return ans;
    }
    public int depth(TreeNode node) {
        if (node == null) return 0;
        int L = depth(node.left);
        int R = depth(node.right);
        ans = Math.max(ans, L+R);
        return Math.max(L, R) + 1;
    }
}
